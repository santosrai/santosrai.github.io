# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with modern web technologies. It features a clean, responsive design with a focus on performance and user experience.

## Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Blog System**: Markdown-based blog posts with syntax highlighting
- **Project Showcase**: Dynamic project gallery with detailed views
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices and screen sizes
- **Static Generation**: Pre-rendered for optimal performance
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and structured data

## Technical Highlights

- Static site generation for fast loading times
- Markdown content management system
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Component-based architecture
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Image optimization and lazy loading

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was migrating from WordPress to a static site while maintaining the content structure. I solved this by creating a custom MDX processing system that maintains backward compatibility with the previous WordPress data structure.

## Future Enhancements

- Add search functionality
- Implement comment system
- Add analytics integration
- Create admin panel for content management
