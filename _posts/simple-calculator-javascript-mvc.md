# Simple calculator in javascript using MVC pattern

## What do I want to do?

I want to write a simple calculator app with plain JavaScript using a Model-View-Controller design pattern.

Check out [Demo](#)

## Process

Creating 3 files only

- **index.html**: It consists of a single root element only in the body tag.
- **style.css**: It has styling for calculator.
- **script.js**: It consists of model, view and controller classes.

## What the heck is the design pattern?

In the programming world, programmers talk about things like singletons, mvc instead of basic terms like int, and arrays.

I am not a big fan of this but you will see many different design patterns used in software applications.

In definition [Design pattern Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern)

A design pattern is the reusable form of a solution to a design problem.

## What is MVC?

MVC(Model View Controller) is one of the popular design patterns.

- **model**: application's data objects are stored
- **view**: User Interface
- **controller**: decision maker which is linked between model and view, such as clicking

## Conclusion

Hope it helps you to understand MVC. Happy Coding
